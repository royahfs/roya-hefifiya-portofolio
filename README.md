# Personal Portfolio Website  
**Project Submission — Coursera**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **personal portfolio website** developed as part of a Coursera web development course.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, as well as the ability to integrate these technologies into a clean, responsive, and user-friendly website suitable for professional presentation.

The website showcases personal information, services, projects, certificates, and contact details in a structured and visually engaging format.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Demonstrate correct and semantic use of **HTML5**
- Apply **CSS3** for layout, styling, and responsive design
- Implement **JavaScript** for user interaction and DOM manipulation
- Build a maintainable, readable, and bug-free codebase
- Create a professional website that could be presented to potential employers

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — Content structure and semantic layout
- **CSS3** — Styling, layout, animations, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — User interaction and dynamic behavior
- **Boxicons** — Icon library for social media and UI elements

---

## 🧩 HTML Proficiency
This project demonstrates strong HTML fundamentals through:
- Proper use of semantic elements such as:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- Clear and structured content hierarchy
- Correct use of headings (`<h1>` – `<h4>`) and paragraph elements
- No deprecated or outdated HTML constructs
- Clean separation of structure from styling and behavior

---

## 🎨 CSS Proficiency
CSS is used effectively to control presentation and layout:
- Organized use of **class selectors** with minimal reliance on IDs
- Logical grouping of styles for readability and maintainability
- Use of **Flexbox and CSS Grid** for layout design
- Responsive design using:
  - Relative units
  - Media queries
- No excessive overrides or inline styling
- Consistent color scheme and visual hierarchy to avoid distraction

---

## ⚙️ JavaScript Proficiency
JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity without controlling layout or styling directly:
- Interactive mobile navigation (hamburger menu)
- DOM manipulation using `querySelector`
- Event handling via click listeners
- Clear and sensible variable naming
- Bug-free functionality
- JavaScript is only used for behavior, not presentation

Example functionality:
```js
menuIcon.onclick = () => {
    menuIcon.classList.toggle('bx-x');
    navbar.classList.toggle('active');
};
